#TODO: 
#TEST THE ROBOT
#How far can it measure.
#and all the other stuff we need to test for the robot

#Important notes:
#Cells are numbered from upper left corner. 

#Angles are in radians and counted Counterclockwise with horisontal pointing right. 

#E.G A particle in cell (25,27) with orientation of Pi/4 will look through the cells (24,28), (23,29) etc. If the orientation was 0 it would look through (26,27), (26,50) etc.

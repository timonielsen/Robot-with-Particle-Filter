Important notes:
Cells are numbered from upper left corner. 

Angles are in radians and counted clockwise with horisontal pointing right. 

E.G A particle in cell (25,27) with orientation of Pi/4 will look through the cells (26,28), (27,29) etc. If the orientation was 0 it would look through (26,27), (50,27) etc.

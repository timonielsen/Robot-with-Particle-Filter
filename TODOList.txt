TODO LIST


- Reassign weights to maze. Check print type 3 (of the maze class) to see how the weights are currently not that good at the end of walls

- Put in stop criterion (for ex. length of path has for 3 iterations been smaller than a threshold)

- Remove all hardcoded values to easier optimise script (do this in a branch to avoid fucking up the master)

DONE!!!- Write and rewrite all robot functions such that when the robot is connected it runs the same script but with actual robot functions.

DONE!!! - Retest measures taken on robot movement 

- Set Correct sleep time for robot rotation

- Compensate for the fact that sensor and center of rotation is not in the same spot.

- Make sure the measurements of the robot correspond with those of particles (now some measurements of particles are -1 e.g at the exit) 

- Optimise algorithm!! This is much easier when hardcoded values are removed and the script has been cleaned up!! (do cleaning in a branch!!!)

- Run physical tests with the robot!

- DONT use the angle %= 360 or angle %= math.pi*2. This only want positive values, and this allows for negative values
